import Modal from '../../components/playground/Modal.tsx';
import Contenedor from '../../components/playground/Contenedor.tsx';

##### **Delete Project Modal**

It all started with this interaction.
I like having confirmation modals for irreversible actions like deleting a project. But most existing options feel clunky, so I decided to experiment with creating my own using Framer Motion.

<Contenedor arrow={false} showDescription={false} client:load>
  <Modal client:load />
</Contenedor>
