##### **Crypto Exchange**

It all started with this interaction.
I like having confirmation modals for irreversible actions like deleting a project. But most existing options feel clunky, so I decided to experiment with creating my own using Framer Motion.

<Contenedor arrow={false} showDescription={false} client:load>
  <Exchange client:load />
</Contenedor>
